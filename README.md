# Assembly-Shape-Printer

Assembly code that, after allowing user to input dimensions of Rectangles, Diamonds, and Triangles, prints back the shapes as output.

The input should look something like this, where the parameters after R represent length and width of the rectangle, the parameter after T and D represents the base of the triangle/diamond, and the period ends the input:
```
R 03 10
T 05
D 11
R 05 15
D 09
T 03
.
```

Further, the parameters can go up to 99, and the base of triangles and diamonds are assumed to always be odd.
